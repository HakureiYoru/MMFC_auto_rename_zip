# Automatic ZIP File Renamer for MMFC Music Library

## Description

This Python script simplifies the process of renaming ZIP files downloaded from the MMFC (https://www.maimaimfc.ink/) chart library. When downloading songs, the ZIP file names generated by the website are often random and uninformative. This script solves the problem by extracting the song titles from the 'maidata.txt' file inside each ZIP archive and automatically renaming the ZIP files with meaningful names. It helps organize and categorize downloaded songs, making it easier to manage large music libraries from MMFC's official website.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Click "Open ZIP Files" to select one or more ZIP files.
3. Click "Rename ZIP Files" to automatically rename them based on the song titles found in 'maidata.txt'.
4. The renamed files will be organized for easier management.

**Note:** Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, and the script's GUI will guide you through the process.
